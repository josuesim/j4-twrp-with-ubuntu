Device tree successfully made, you can find it in samsung/j4lteub

Note: This device tree should already work, but there can be something that prevent booting the recovery, for example a kernel with OEM modifications that doesn't let boot a custom recovery, or that disable touch on recovery
If this is the case, then see if OEM provide kernel sources and build the kernel by yourself
Here below there is the generation log
